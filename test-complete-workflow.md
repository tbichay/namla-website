- [x] Batch enhancement: `/api/admin/projects/[id]/media/batch-enhance`
- [x] Reference image upload: `/api/admin/upload-reference-image`

### UI Components
- [x] AI Enhancement Modal with batch mode support
- [x] Batch selection interface in project edit page
- [x] Reference image upload with server storage
- [x] Style library system for saved styles

### AI Enhancement Service
- [x] Style transfer with reference image support
- [x] Multi-model enhancement pipeline
- [x] Proper error handling and fallbacks

## üéØ Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Setup Test Environment

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to admin panel
http://localhost:3000/admin/projects/[existing-project-id]/edit
```

### 2. Test Single Image Enhancement

1. Navigate to project edit page
2. Click enhance button (sparkles icon) on any image
3. Upload a reference image using the upload area
4. Choose "Style Transfer Luxury" preset
5. Click "Preview Enhancement"
6. Verify AI processing works
7. Apply enhancement and verify image updates

### 3. Test Batch Style Application

1. Click "Batch Mode" button in media section
2. Select multiple images using checkboxes
3. Verify selected count updates correctly
4. Click "Apply Style to Selected (X)"
5. Upload reference image for style transfer
6. Choose enhancement preset
7. Click "Apply to X Images"
8. Verify all images are processed with consistent style

### 4. Test Reference Image Upload

1. Open AI enhancement modal
2. Drag and drop an image to reference upload area
3. Verify upload progress and success message
4. Verify image appears in preview
5. Verify server URL is used (not blob URL)

### 5. Test Style Library

1. Upload reference image
2. Save style with custom name
3. Verify style appears in library
4. Apply saved style to different image
5. Verify consistent results

## üîç Expected Results

### Single Image Enhancement
- Original image URL saved to `originalUrl` field
- Enhanced image URL replaces main `url` field
- Preview shows before/after comparison
- Enhancement applied only after confirmation

### Batch Processing
- All selected images processed with same style
- Consistent enhancement across all images
- Progress indication during processing
- Success/failure reporting for each image

### Reference Image Handling
- Reference images uploaded to R2 storage
- Server URLs used for AI processing
- Reference images persist for reuse
- Style library maintains reference image links

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for failed uploads
- Graceful handling of AI processing failures
- Network error recovery
- Validation of file types and sizes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues to Check

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure REPLICATE_API_TOKEN and R2 credentials are set
2. **File Permissions**: Verify R2 bucket permissions for uploads
3. **Model Availability**: Check if Replicate models are accessible
4. **Database Connections**: Ensure Neon database is reachable
5. **CORS Issues**: Verify API endpoints are accessible from frontend

## üöÄ Production Readiness

- [ ] Load testing with multiple concurrent enhancements
- [ ] Cost monitoring for AI API usage
- [ ] Performance optimization for large batches
- [ ] Backup strategy for original images
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerting

## üìä Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Reference image upload < 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ Single image enhancement < 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Batch processing scales linearly
- ‚úÖ Error rate < 5% for valid inputs
- ‚úÖ Consistent style application across batches
